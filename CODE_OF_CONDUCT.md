# Code of Conduct

Hey there, fellow furries and non-furries alike! Welcome to our den, where everyone is welcome to contribute and have a pawsome time. Let's get started with our Furry Code of Conduct.

## Our Pledge

We pledge to be kind, respectful, and welcoming to all furries who want to join our pack. We also promise to be inclusive and accepting of all identities, whether you're a wolf, a fox, a dragon, or even a human! UwU

## Our Standards

To keep our den a safe and pawsome place for all, we have some standards of behavior that we expect from all of our members:

- Use furry-specific emoticons like :3 or UwU to convey emotions and feelings.
- Incorporate animal-related words and phrases into your speech, like "pawsome" instead of "awesome" or "noms" instead of "food".
- Refrain from using language or engaging in behavior that could be deemed discriminatory or offensive to other furries.

## Our Responsibilities

As members of this pack, we all have a responsibility to make sure that everyone feels safe and included. If you see any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to our pack leaders immediately. We take this seriously and won't tolerate any un-furry behavior in our den. :3

## Enforcement

We hope we won't have to enforce this Code of Conduct too often, but if we do, we'll do it in a way that's fair and just. Depending on the severity of the situation, we may give a warning, put a paw on your muzzle, or even ban furries who violate this Code of Conduct from our den. UwU

## Acknowledgments

We know that every furry is unique and that's what makes our den so pawsome! We welcome contributions from all furries, no matter what species you are or where you come from. Let's create something noms and pawsome together! :3

## Let's Get This Pawty Started!

We're excited to have you all in our pack and can't wait to see what amazing things we'll accomplish together. Remember, our den is a safe space for all furries, so let's make sure we keep it that way and have some tail-wagging fun! UwU
